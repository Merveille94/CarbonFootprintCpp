## Overview

The Carbon Footprint Calculator is a tool to raise awareness about personal contributions to carbon emissions. By understanding these contributions, individuals can make more informed decisions to reduce their impact on the environment. This calculator provides estimates based on common emission factors for each category of activity.

## Features

- **Transportation**: Calculate emissions based on miles driven and vehicle fuel efficiency.
- **Electricity Usage**: Estimate emissions based on electricity consumption in kilowatt-hours.
- **Waste Management**: Evaluate emissions based on the number of people in a household.

## Usage

1. **Compile and Run**: Compile the C++ code using a compatible compiler like `g++`, then run the executable to start the program.

   ```bash
   g++ -o CarbonFootprintCalculator CarbonFootprintCalculator.cpp
   ./CarbonFootprintCalculator
   ```

2. **Choose an Option**: Upon running, the program displays a menu. Select the activity you wish to calculate:
    - Press `1` for Transportation.
    - Press `2` for Electricity Usage.
    - Press `3` for Waste Management.

3. **Enter Required Data**: Follow the prompts to enter necessary data, such as miles driven, electricity usage, or household size.

4. **View Results**: The program will calculate and display your carbon footprint for the chosen category.

5. **Repeat or Quit**: After each calculation, you can choose another option or quit the program by entering 'Q'.

## Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Basic understanding of running console applications

## Development Timeline

This project was initially developed in May 2024 on my local machine. The project completion was delayed due to internet issues, but it is now available for use and further development.

## Future Updates

The Carbon Footprint Calculator is planned to be expanded into a web application using React, with the development starting in June 2024. The web version will provide a more user-friendly interface and enhanced features for a broader audience.
